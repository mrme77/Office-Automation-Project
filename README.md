    "- **Find and Remove Identical Files:** \n",
    "It finds identical files based on the SHA1 algorithm, and moves them to path_duplicates..SHA1 is in a hash or message digest algorithm where it generates 160-bit unique value from the input data. The input data size doesnâ€™t matter as SHA1 always generates the same size message digest or hash which is 160 bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Remove Duplicate Rows Excel Document:**\n",
    "The VBA subroutine removes duplicate rows based on the content of multiple columns.\n",
